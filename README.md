## Building

You can follow these instructions to build the app and install it onto your device.

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Flutter, please first follow the [Flutter Setup](https://flutter.dev/setup/) guide.

### Building and installing the Flutter Design Patterns app

```
git clone https://github.com/mkobuolys/flutter-design-patterns.git
cd flutter-design-patterns
flutter pub get
